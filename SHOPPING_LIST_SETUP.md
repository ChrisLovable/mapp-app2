# Shopping List Feature Setup

## Overview
The Shopping List feature has been implemented as an exact replica of the TodoModal but adapted for shopping items. It includes:

- **Item Description**: The main item name (e.g., "milk", "apples")
- **Quantity**: How much to buy (e.g., "2", "1 gallon", "a dozen")
- **Vendor**: Where to buy from (e.g., "Walmart", "Target", "Any")

## Features
- ✅ **AI Parsing**: Automatically extracts shopping items from natural language input
- ✅ **New Items Section**: Add and edit items before saving
- ✅ **Saved Items Section**: View and manage your shopping list
- ✅ **Complete Items**: Mark items as completed
- ✅ **Same UI/UX**: Identical styling and behavior to the TodoModal
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Stores items in Supabase

## Database Setup

### 1. Create the shopping_items table
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create shopping_items table for the ShoppingListModal
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shopping_items (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  quantity TEXT DEFAULT '1',
  vendor TEXT DEFAULT 'Any',
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE shopping_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows all operations (for development)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on shopping_items" ON shopping_items
  FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Create an index on created_at for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_shopping_items_created_at ON shopping_items(created_at DESC);

-- Optional: Create an index on completed status
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_shopping_items_completed ON shopping_items(completed);
```

### 2. Verify the table was created
You should see a new `shopping_items` table in your Supabase dashboard under Database > Tables.

## Usage

### How to Use
1. **Click the "BUY" button** in the main grid
2. **Enter shopping items** in the main text input (e.g., "buy 2 apples from Walmart and 1 gallon of milk")
3. **The AI will parse** your input into structured items
4. **Edit items** if needed in the "New Items" section
5. **Click "Confirm"** to save each item
6. **View saved items** in the "Saved Items" section
7. **Mark as completed** when you've purchased items

### Example Inputs
- "buy milk, bread, and eggs"
- "need 2 apples from Walmart and 1 gallon of milk from Target"
- "shopping list: bananas, cereal, yogurt"
- "get 3 cans of soup and a dozen eggs"

### Multi-language Support
The shopping list now supports multiple languages! When you select a language other than English:
- Input is automatically translated to English before parsing
- Translation is handled by OpenAI GPT-4
- Original input is preserved in debug logs
- Works with all supported languages in the language selector

**Example**: If you select Spanish and type "comprar leche y pan", it will be translated to "buy milk and bread" before parsing.

### Features Identical to TodoModal
- ✅ Same color scheme (royal blue to grey header, green new items, blue saved items)
- ✅ Same button styling (3D effects, hover animations)
- ✅ Same modal layout and structure
- ✅ Same error handling and loading states
- ✅ Same database operations (CRUD)
- ✅ Same responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/ShoppingListModal.tsx` - New component
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Added integration
- `src/components/AppGrid.tsx` - Added BUY button handler
- `shopping_items_table.sql` - Database setup script

### Key Features
- **AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to parse natural language into structured shopping items
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatically translates non-English input to English before parsing
- **Real-time Parsing**: Automatically parses input when the modal opens
- **Editable Fields**: All fields (description, quantity, vendor) are editable before saving
- **Database Persistence**: Items are saved to Supabase and persist between sessions
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark items as completed and they're visually updated

## Testing

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Input**: "buy milk" → Should create item with description "Milk", quantity "1", vendor "Any"
2. **Complex Input**: "get 2 apples from Walmart and 1 gallon of milk" → Should create 2 separate items
3. **No Input**: Opening modal without input should show empty "New Items" section
4. **Edit Items**: Should be able to modify description, quantity, and vendor before confirming
5. **Complete Items**: Clicking "Completed" should mark items as done and show strikethrough

### Error Handling
- ✅ API key missing
- ✅ Network errors
- ✅ Invalid JSON responses
- ✅ Database connection issues
- ✅ Empty or invalid input

## Next Steps
The shopping list feature is now fully implemented and ready to use! The implementation follows the exact same patterns as the TodoModal, ensuring consistency and reliability.
